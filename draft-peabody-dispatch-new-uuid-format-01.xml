            This document presents new time-based UUID formats which are suited for use as a database key.
        </t>
        <t>
            A common case for modern applications is to create a unique identifier for use as a primary key in a database table.
			This identifier usually implements an embedded timestamp that is sortable using the monotonic creation time in the most significant bits. 
			In addition the identifier is highly collision resistant, difficult to guess, and provides minimal security attack surfaces.
			None of the existing UUID versions, including UUIDv1, fulfill each of these requirements in the most efficient possible way.
			This document is a proposal to update <xref target="RFC4122"/> with three new UUID versions that address these concerns, each with different trade-offs.

        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
        this document are to be interpreted as described in
        <xref target="RFC2119"/>.

    <section anchor="Background" title="Background">
        <t>
            A lot of things have changed in the time since UUIDs were originally created.
            Modern applications have a need to use (and many have already implemented) UUIDs
            as database primary keys.
        </t>
        <t>
            The motivation for using UUIDs as database keys stems primarily from the fact that applications
            are increasingly distributed in nature. Simplistic "auto increment" schemes
            with integers in sequence do not work well in a distributed system since the effort required to
            synchronize such numbers across a network can easily become a burden.  
            The fact that UUIDs can be used to create unique and reasonably short values in 
			distributed systems without requiring synchronization makes them a good candidate 
			for use as a database key in such environments.
        </t>
        <t>
            However some properties of <xref target="RFC4122"/> UUIDs are not well suited to this task.
			First, most of the existing UUID versions such as UUIDv4 have poor database index locality.
			Meaning new values created in succession are not close to each other in the index and thus require 
            inserts to be performed at random locations. The negative performance effects of which on 
            common structures used for this (B-tree and its variants) can be dramatic. As such newly inserted 
            values SHOULD be time-ordered to address this.
        </t>
        <t>
			While it is true that UUIDv1 does contain an embedded timestamp
			and can be time-ordered; UUIDv1 has other issues. It is possible to sort 
            Version 1 UUIDs by time but it is a laborious task. The process requires breaking the bytes of the UUID 
			into various pieces, re-ordering the bits, and then determining the order from the reconstructed timestamp. This 
			is not efficient in very large systems. Implementations would be simplified with a sort order where the
			UUID can simply be treated as an opaque sequence of bytes and ordered as such.
        </t>
        <t>
            After the embedded timestamp, the remaining 64 bits are in essence used to provide uniqueness both on a global scale and
			within a given timestamp tick. The clock sequence value ensures that when multiple UUIDs are 
			generated for the same timestamp value are given a monotonic sequence value. This explicit sequencing 
			helps further facilitate sorting. The remaining random bits ensure collisions are minimal.
        </t>
		<t>
			Furthermore, UUIDv1 utilizes a non-standard timestamp epoch derived from the Gregorian Calendar. More 
			specifically, the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) as a count of 100-nanosecond intervals since 
			00:00:00.00, 15 October 1582. Implementations and many languages may find it easier to implement the widely adopted and well known 
			Unix Epoch, a custom epoch, or another timestamp source with various levels of timestamp precision required by the application.
        </t>
		<t>
            Lastly, privacy and network security issues arise from using a MAC address in the node field of Version 1 UUIDs.
            Exposed MAC addresses can be used as an attack surface to locate machines and reveal various other
            information about such machines (minimally manufacturer, potentially other details). Instead 
			"cryptographically secure" pseudo-random number generators (CSPRNGs) or pseudo-random number generators (PRNG) 
			SHOULD be used within an application context to provide uniqueness and unguessability.
        </t>
		<t>
			Due to the shortcomings of UUIDv1 and UUIDv4 details so far, many widely distributed database applications 
			and large application vendors have sought to solve the problem of creating a better 
			time-based, sortable unique identifier for use as a database key. This has lead to numerous implementations 
			over the past 10+ years solving the same problem in slightly different ways.
        </t>
		<t>
		   While preparing this specification the following 16 different implementations were analyzed for trends in total ID length, bit Layout, lexical formatting/encoding, timestamp type, timestamp format, timestamp accuracy, node format/components, collision handling and multi-timestamp tick generation sequencing.

    <section anchor="Changes" title="Summary of Changes">
        <t>
        In order to solve these challenges this specification introduces three new version identifiers assigned 
		for time-based UUIDs.
		</t>
		<t>
		The first, UUIDv6, aims to be the easiest to implement for applications which already
		implement UUIDv1. The UUIDv6 specification keeps the original Gregorian timestamp source but does not reorder the timestamp bits as per the process  
		utilized by UUIDv1. UUIDv6 also requires that pseudo-random data MUST be used in place of the MAC address.
		The rest of the UUIDv1 format remains unchanged in UUIDv6. See <xref target="uuidv6layout"/>
        </t>
		<t>
		Next, UUIDv7 introduces an entirely new time-based UUID bit layout utilizing a variable length timestamp sourced from the 
		widely implemented and well known Unix Epoch timestamp source.
        The timestamp is broken into a 36-bit integer sections part, and is followed by a field of variable length which
        represents the sub-second timestamp portion, encoded so that each bit from most to least significant adds more precision. See <xref target="uuidv7layout"/>
		</t>
		<t>
		Finally, UUIDv8 introduces a relaxed time-based UUID format that caters to application implementations
		that cannot utilize UUIDv1, UUIDv6, or UUIDv7. UUIDv8 also future-proofs this specification by allowing 
		time-based UUID formats from timestamp sources that are not yet be defined. The variable size timestamp offers
		lots of flexibility to create an implementation specific RFC compliant time-based UUID while retaining the 
		properties that make UUID great. See <xref target="uuidv8layout"/>
        </t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="format" title="Format">
        <t>
		The UUID length of 16 octets (128 bits) remains unchanged. The textual representation of a UUID consisting of 36
        hexadecimal and dash characters in the format 8-4-4-4-12 remains unchanged for human readability.
        In addition the position of both the Version and Variant bits remain unchanged in the layout.

			<t>
			UUIDv6 aims to be the easiest to implement by reusing most of the layout of bits

			Where UUIDv1 splits the timestamp bits into three distinct parts and orders them as
			time_low, time_mid, time_high_and_version. UUIDv6 instead keeps the source bits
			from the timestamp intact and changes the order to time_high, time_mid, and time_low.
			Incidentally this will match the original 60-bit Gregorian timestamp source.
			The clock sequence bits remain unchanged from their usage and position in <xref target="RFC4122"/>.

					 Since the UUIDv7 Unix timestamp is fixed at 36 bits in length the exact layout for encoding UUIDv7 depends on the precision (number of bits)
					 used for the sub-second portion and the sizes of the optionally desired sequence counter and node bits.
					</t>
					<t>
						Three examples of UUIDv7 encoding are given below as a general guidelines but implementations are not limited to just these three examples.
					</t>
					<t>
						All of these fields are only used during encoding, and during decoding the system is unaware of the bit layout used for them and considers this information opaque.
						As such, implementations generating these values can assign whatever lengths to each field it deems applicable, as long as it does not break decoding compatibility
						(i.e. Unix timestamp (unixts), version (ver) and variant (var) have to stay where they are, and clock sequence counter (seq), random (random) or other implementation specific values must follow the sub-second encoding).

					When decoding or parsing a UUIDv7 value there are only two values to be considered:
				</t>
				<ol>
					<li><t>The unix timestamp defined as unixts</t></li>
					<li><t>The sub-second precision values defined as subsec_a, subsec_b, and subsec_seq_node</t></li>
				</ol>
				<t>As detailed in Figure 2 the unix timestamp (unixts) is always the first 36 bits of the UUIDv7 layout.</t>
				<t>
					Similarly as per Figure 2, the sub-second precision values lie within subsec_a, subsec_b, and subsec_seq_node which are all interpreted as sub-second information after skipping over the version (ver) and (var) bits.  
					These concatenated sub-second information bits are interpreted in a way where most to least significant bits represent a further division by two.
					This is the same normal place notation used to express fractional numbers, except in binary. For example, in decimal ".1" means one tenth, and ".01" means one hundredth.
					In this subsec field, a 1 means one half, 01 means one quarter, 001 is one eighth, etc.
					This scheme can work for any number of bits up to the maximum available, and keeps the most significant data leftmost in the bit sequence.
				</t>
				<t>
					To perform the sub-second math, simply take the first (most significant/leftmost) N bits of subsec and divide it by 2^N. Take for example:
				</t>
				<ol>
						<li><t>To parse the first 16 bits, extract that value as an integer and divide it by 65536 (2 to the 16th).</t></li>
						<li><t>If these 16 bits are 0101 0101 0101 0101, then treating that as an integer gives 0x5555 or 21845 in decimal, and dividing by 65536 gives 0.3333282</t></li>
				</ol>		
				<t>
				This sub-second encoding scheme provides maximum interoperability across systems where different levels of time precision are required/feasible/available.
				The timestamp value derived from a UUIDv7 value SHOULD be "as close to the correct value as possible" when parsed, even across disparate systems. 
				</t>
				<t>
				Take for example the starting point for our next two UUIDv7 parsing scenarios:
				</t>
				<ol>
					<li>System A produces a UUIDv7 with a microsecond-precise timestamp value.</li>
					<li>System B is unaware of the precision encoded in the UUIDv7 timestamp by System A.</li>
				</ol>
				<t>
				Scenario 1:
				</t>
				<ol>
					<li>System B parses the embedded timestamp with millisecond precision. (Less precision than the encoder)</li>
					<li>System B SHOULD return the correct millisecond value encoded by system A (truncated to milliseconds).</li>
				</ol>
				<t>
				Scenario 2:
				</t>
				<ol>
					<li>System B parses the timestamp with nanosecond precision. (More precision than the encoder)</li>
					<li>System B's value returned SHOULD have the same microsecond level of precision provided by the encoder with the additional precision down to nanosecond level being essentially random as per the encoded random value at the end of the UUIDv7.</li>

        UUIDv8 offers variable-size timestamp, clock sequence, and node values
        which allow for a highly customizable UUID that fits a given application needs.
		</t>
		<t>
        UUIDv8 SHOULD only be utilized if an implementation cannot utilize UUIDv1, UUIDv6, or UUIDv8.
        Some situations in which UUIDv8 usage could occur:
		</t>
		<ul>
            <li><t>An implementation would like to utilize a timestamp source
              not defined by the current time-based UUIDs.</t></li>
            <li><t>An implementation would like to utilize a timestamp bit layout
              not defined by the current time-based UUIDs.</t></li>
            <li><t>An implementation would like a specific level of precision
              within the timestamp not offered by current time-based UUIDs.</t></li>
            <li><t>An implementation would like to embed extra information
              within the UUID node other than what is defined in this document.</t></li>
            <li><t>An implementation has other application/language restrictions which
              inhibit the usage of one of the current time-based UUIDs.</t></li>
		</ul>
		<t>
        Roughly speaking a properly formatted UUIDv8 SHOULD contain
        the following sections adding up to a total of 128-bits.
		</t>
		<ul spacing="compact" empty="true">
            <li><t>- Timestamp Bits (Variable Length)</t></li>
            <li><t>- Clock Sequence Bits (Variable Length)</t></li>
            <li><t>- Node Bits (Variable Length)</t></li>
            <li><t>- UUIDv8 Version Bits (4 bits)</t></li>
            <li><t>- UUID Variant Bits (2 Bits)</t></li>
		</ul>
		<t>
        The only explicitly defined bits are the Version and Variant leaving 122 bits
        for implementation specific time-based UUIDs. To be clear:
        UUIDv8 is not a replacement for UUIDv4 where all 122 extra bits are
        filled with random data. UUIDv8's 128 bits (including the version and variant)
        SHOULD contain at the minimum a timestamp of some format in the most
        significant bit position followed directly by a clock sequence counter
        and finally a node containing either random data or implementation specific data.
		</t>

        A sample format in Figure 6 is used to further illustrate the point
        for the 16-octet, 128-bit UUIDv8.

			<t>
            UUIDv8's usage of timestamp relaxes both the timestamp source
            and timestamp length. Implementations are free to utilize
            any monotonically stable timestamp source for UUIDv8.
			</t>
			<t>
            Some examples include:
			</t>
			<ul spacing="compact"  empty="true">
                <li><t>- Custom Epoch</t></li>

                <li><t>- ISO 8601 timestamp</t></li>
			</ul>
			<t>
            The relaxed nature UUIDv8 timestamps also works to future proof
            this specification and allow implementations a method to create
            compliant time-based UUIDs using timestamp source that might not yet be defined.
			</t>
			<t>
            Timestamps come in many sizes and UUIDv8 defines three fields
            that can easily used for the majority of timestamp lengths:
			</t>
			<ul>
                <li><t>32-bit timestamp: using timestamp_32 and setting timestamp_48 to 0s</t></li>
                <li><t>48-bit timestamp: using timestamp_32 and timestamp_48 entirely</t></li>
                <li><t>60-bit timestamp: using timestamp_32, timestamp_48, and time_or_seq</t></li>
                <li><t>64-bit timestamp: using timestamp_32, timestamp_48, and time_or_seq
                  and truncating the timestamp the 60 most significant bits.</t></li>
			</ul>
			<t>
            Although it is possible to create a timestamp larger than 64-bits in size
            The usage and bit layout of that timestamp format is up to the implementation.
            When a timestamp exceeds the 64th bit (octet 7), extra care must be taken to
            ensure the Variant bits are properly inserted at their respective location
            in the UUID. Likewise, the Version MUST always be implemented at the appropriate
            location.
			</t>
			<t>
            Any timestamps that does not entirely fill the timestamp_32, timestamp_48
            or time_or_seq MUST set all leftover bits in the least significant position
            of the respective field to 0. For example a 36-bit timestamp source would
            fully utilize timestamp_32 and 4-bits of timestamp_48.
            The remaining 12-bits in timestamp_48 MUST be set to 0.
			</t>
			<t>
            By using implementation-specific timestamp sources it is not
            guaranteed that devices outside of the application context are able to
            extract and parse the timestamp from UUIDv8 without some pre-existing
            knowledge of the source timestamp used by the UUIDv8 implementation.
			</t>
            </section>
            <section anchor="uuidv8sequence" title="UUIDv8 Clock Sequence Usage">
			<t>
            A clock sequence MUST be used with UUIDv8 as added sequencing guarantees
            when multiple UUIDv8 will be created on the same clock tick.
            The amount of bits allocated to the clock sequence depends on the
            precision of the timestamp source. For example, a more accurate timestamp source using
            nanosecond precision will require less clock sequence bits than a timestamp
            source utilizing seconds for precision.
			</t>
			<t>
            The UUIDv8 layout in Figure 6 generically defines two possible
            clock sequence values that can leveraged:
			</t>
			<ul spacing="compact">
                <li><t>12-bit clock sequence using time_or_seq for use when the timestamp
                  is less than 48-bits which allows for 4095 UUIDs per clock tick.</t></li>
                <li><t>8-bit clock sequence using seq_or_node when the timestamp uses
                  more than 48-bits which allows for 255 UUIDs per clock tick.</t></li>
			</ul>
			<t>
            An implementation MAY use both time_or_seq and seq_or_node for clock sequencing
            however it is highly unlikely that 20-bits of clock sequence are needed
            for a given clock tick. Furthermore, more bits from the node MAY be used
            for clock sequencing in the event that 8-bits is not sufficient.
			</t>
			<t>
            The clock sequence MUST start at zero and increment monotonically
            for each new UUID created on by the application on the same timestamp.
            When the timestamp increments the clock sequence MUST be reset to zero.
            The clock sequence MUST NOT rollover or reset to zero unless the timestamp
            has incremented. Care MUST be given to ensure that an adequate sized
            clock sequence is selected for a given application based on expected
            timestamp precision and expected UUID generation rates.

            An implementation MAY choose to allocate bits from the node to the timestamp,
            clock sequence or application-specific embedded field.
            It is recommended that implementation utilize a node of at least 48-bits to
            ensure global uniqueness can be guaranteed.

        UUIDs created by this specification offer the same guarantees for global uniqueness 
		as those found in <xref target="RFC4122"/>. Furthermore, the time-based UUIDs defined in this specification 
		are geared towards database applications but MAY be used for a wide variety of use-cases. 
		Just as global uniqueness is guaranteed, UUIDs are guaranteed to be unique within an application 
		context within the enterprise domain.

    <section anchor="distributed" title="Distributed UUID Generation">
        <t>
        Some implementations might desire to utilize multi-node, clustered, applications which involve 2 or more 
		applications independently generating UUIDs that will be stored in a common location. UUIDs already feature sufficient 
		entropy to ensure that the chances of collision are low. However, implementations MAY dedicate a 
		portion of the node's most significant random bits to a pseudo-random machineID which helps identify 
		UUIDs created by a given node. This works to add an extra layer of collision avoidance.
		</t>
		<t>
		This machine ID MUST be placed in the UUID proceeding the timestamp and sequence counter bits. 
		This position is selected to ensure that the sorting by timestamp and clock sequence is still possible. 
		The machineID MUST NOT be an IEEE 802 MAC address. The creation and negotiation of the machineID 
		among distributed nodes is out of scope for this specification.

    </section>
    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
        <t> 
        MAC addresses pose inherent security risks and MUST not be used for node generation. 
		As such they have been strictly forbidden from time-based UUIDs within this specification.
		Instead pseudo-random bits SHOULD selected from a source with sufficient entropy to ensure guaranteed
		uniqueness among UUID generation.
        </t>
        <t>
        Timestamps embedded in the UUID do pose a very small attack surface. The timestamp in conjunction with 
		the clock sequence does signal the order of creation for a given UUID and it's corresponding data but 
		does not define anything about the data itself or the application as a whole. If UUIDs are required for
		use with any security operation within an application context in any shape or form then <xref target="RFC4122"/> UUIDv4 
		SHOULD be utilized.
        </t>
        <t>
        The machineID portion of node, described in <xref target="distributed"/>, does 
		provide small unique identifier which could be used to determine which application is generating 
		data but this machineID alone is not enough to identify a node on the network without other corresponding 
		data points. Furthermore the machineID, like the timestamp+sequence, does not provide any context about 
		the data the corresponds to the UUID or the current state of the application as a whole.
